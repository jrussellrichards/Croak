# Croak

the Croak Game is a strategy game, where you have 2 groups of frogs looking straight ahead.

Each frog can only advance one space to the front or jump to a frog in front of it as long as there is a space after it.

The board has 3 frogs in each group and an empty space between them, is won when all the frogs are in the position of the opposite group in which they started.

The game has the logic to decide when there are no moves available. When this happens, it is considered as lost
